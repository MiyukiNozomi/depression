<h2>Temporary Goodbye</h2>
<p>Over the past month, i've been struggling to keep this website up and ready for public usage.
However, there's simply no way for me to continue hosting it by myself with my current situation.
<br/>
I didn't want to end this project like this, I always dreamed of having a website where I could show off all
my best, but all I've shown here was disappointment and unfunny jokes.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for wasting your time.<br>
I hope I can provide a better website next time.
